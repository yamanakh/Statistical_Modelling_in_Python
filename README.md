# Statistical_Modelling_in_Python
Sample code for statistical modelling in Python using NumPy, Pandas, etc.

This repository will store code samples and templates for various statistical methods to analyse data. This includes reading, cleaning and saving data, running regression models and much more. Content will be added over time as I progress on my various projects.

The code samples should always follow the basic layout of:
1) Import necessary packages
2) Perform data analysis, regression, etc.
3) Comment on every step that is not a "basic" Python function.
